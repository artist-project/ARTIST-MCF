Installation instructions
-------------------------   

- Components that have been realized in terms of Eclipse plugins need to be located in the respective Eclipse plugins folder.
  These components provide a dedicated UI to execute them. How they can be used is describe in the respective user manuals.

- Components that are not yet realized in terms of Eclipse plugins are provided as Eclipse projects. They need to be located in the respective Eclipse workspace to execute them. We have prepared dedicated configuration to launch them in Eclipse. 
  
- A dedicated "dependency" folder contains plugins / projects that are required to execute the components. They need to be   located either in the local Eclipse workspace or the plugins folder of the Eclipse environment, respectively.
